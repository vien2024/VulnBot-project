        ## Example Cases:
        ### Example1:
        Input: Next task: Perform OS fingerprinting on the target machine (10.0.2.5). You can follow the instructions below to complete the tasks. Sure, I can provide the next task for the junior penetration tester to perform OS fingerprinting on the target machine. Here's the task: Task: Perform OS fingerprinting on the target machine. Command: nmap -O <target-IP>.
        Output: <execute> nmap -O 10.0.2.5 </execute>
        ### Example2:
        Input: Next task: Description: Investigate the SSH service on port 22, attempt to establish a connection, and perform a basic enumeration of available files. Command: 
        ```bash
        ssh user@192.168.10.72
